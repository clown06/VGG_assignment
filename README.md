# Introduction
## In this version, the VGG model was mainly modified and built for train_comvnet_pytorch. py and convnet_pytorch. py, and training and testing were completed. In addition, for the convenience of using DataLoader to load data, slight modifications were made to cifar10_utils. py, and comments were added (the __len__ and __getitem__ functions were added to the Dataset class)
